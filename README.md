# SimpleStorage with Proxy Smart Contract
---
#### Abstract
The goal of this repository is to learn how `Proxy Smart Contract` works using verified Solidity library -- [OppenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable), 
showcasing the brief concept of `Proxy Smart Contract` with `@Upgradeable` by implementing a sample `SimpleStorage.sol`, deploy
it on `Sepolia Testnet` and using delegatecall and fallback to upgrade from `V1` to `V2`.
